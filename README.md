# strawberry_diagnosis

A new Flutter project. I believe this is all the functionality nessicary for a functional disease detection app. The code incorperates the following:
* Functional login page that can we set up with email address (Not SSO capable on this version)
* Functional lambda image upload with either camera (un-tested) or from photos
* Functional DynamoDB read

Next Steps:
* Better designed UI
* SSO login abilities
* Fix time stamp (I belive the null return is a problem in the lambda code)

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
